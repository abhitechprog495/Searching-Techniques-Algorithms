Algorithm for Binary Search (Ascending Order)

Step 1 – START
Step 2 – Set low, high
Step 3 – if low > high, then the element is not found!
Step 4 – mid = (low + high)/2
Step 5 – if x = list[mid], then show element x is found at position mid
Step 6 – if x < list[mid], then high = mid - 1
Step 7 – if x > list[mid], then low = mid + 1
Step 8 – Repeat Steps 3 To 6 until element is founded!
Step 9 – STOP
