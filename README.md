# Searching-Techniques-Algorithms

NOTE : These are not codes. These are just logic of the codes to make code run smoothly without any problem.
The algorithms are in very easy language.

1. BINARY ALGORITHM

There are two algorithms given in it viz. Ascending and Descending Order.
Ascending and Descending Order is the order of elements and binary search is totally work on the order of the elements.
It works according to order of elements.

2. LINEAR ALGORITHM

This is the algorithm for linear search.
